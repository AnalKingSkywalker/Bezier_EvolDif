# Spider robot leg trajectory as a bilevel optimization problem
This work focuses on the implementation of a reference generator for the motion from the legs of a spider robot, using a reference signal that replicates the motion of an arachnid to generate optimal BÃ©zier polynomials for trajectories that are applied to it. To compute the optimal trajectories, a genetic algorithm is used to solve a bilevel problem, where the upper level corresponds to the number of polynomials required to emulate the biological motion and the lower level corresponds to the optimization of the parameters for each polynomial. The performance function of the upper level also considers the computational cost in order to minimize the resources required to implement the trajectory generator. The optimized trajectory generator is evaluated on a spider robot implemented in a simulation environment to assure that the resulting trajectories are feasible.
