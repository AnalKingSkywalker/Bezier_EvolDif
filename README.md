# Bezier_EvolDif
This work presents a reference generator for spider robot legs using BÃ©zier polynomials optimized via a genetic algorithm. A bilevel approach defines the number and parameters of polynomials, considering both motion accuracy and computational cost. Results are validated in a simulation environment.
